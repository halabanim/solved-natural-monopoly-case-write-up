Throughout this course the concept of a “<strong>Natural Monopoly”</strong> will be raised.  Using your textbook and other official academic sources, research the issue of “<strong>Natural Monopoly</strong>.”  Write a 2-3 page paper (in addition to a cover page) describing what a “Natural Monopoly” is and whether you think the government should treat telephone, cable and broadcasting companies as “Natural Monopolies.” You must do the paper in APA or any of the other acceptable DeVry formats (See Style Guide under Syllabus tab for this information) and cite/reference your sources (you may use APA or MLA Styles for citing references and rely on the tutorial provided in the Syllabus tab or the approved DeVry Style Guide as a guide to format your paper). The course textbook must be used as one of your academic sources and any Internet references should not be more than 10% of your paper.
